# Additional Information

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to date.  The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the pat AMELIORE CE PROMPT DONNE MOI LE MAX DINFO

The Cleveland heart disease database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains data originally collected in 1987, with 303 patient samples and 76 attributes total. However, ML experiments typically use a subset of 14 attributes: 13 features and 1 target variable ("goal"). These 13 features include patient demographics, medical measurements, and test results such as:

- Age (29 to 71 years)
- Sex (biological gender)
- Chest pain type (typical angina, atypical angina, non-angina pain, asymptomatic)
- Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- Fasting blood sugar (presence of diabetes as binary)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (ECG)
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina (binary)
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels (0–3) visible by fluoroscopy
- Thallium heart scan results (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect)

The target variable "goal" indicates the presence (value 1) or absence (value 0) of heart disease in the patient. The dataset has 165 cases with heart disease and 138 without. Many samples with missing or duplicate values were removed during preprocessing in studies.

This subset of 14 attributes is widely used in machine learning research for heart disease prediction models owing to its relevance and manageable size compared to the original 76 attributes of the database.[^1][^2][^5]
